# Introduction
The key of making money is through Investing, People often invest in Stocks, Liquid gold, crypto currency etc. 
One of the important investment is Real estate market, Real Estate Property is not only the basic need of a man but today it also represents the riches and prestige of a person.
Investment in real estate generally seems to be profitable because their property values do not decline rapidly.
Changes in the  real estate price can affect various household investors, bankers, policy makers and many. 
Investment in real estate sector seems to be an attractive choice for the investments. Thus, predicting the real estate value is an important economic index. 
India ranks second in the world in number of households according to 2011 census with a number of 24.67 crore. 
According to the 2017 version of Emerging Trends in Real Estate Asia Pacific, Mumbai and Bangalore are the top-ranked cities for investment and development. 
These cities have supplanted Tokyo and Sydney. The house prices of 22 cities out of 26 dropped in the quarter from April to June when compared to the quarter January to March according to National Housing Bank’s Residex(residential index). With the introduction of Real Estate Regulation Development Act (RERA) and Benami property Act throughout the country India, more number of investors are attracted to invest into real estate in India. The strengthening and modernizing of the Indian economy has made India as attractive Investment destination. However, past recessions show that real estate prices cannot necessarily grow. Prices of the real estate property are related to the economic conditions of the state In India, the real estate sector is the second-highest employment generator, after the agriculture sector. Real estate sector in India is expected to reach US$ 1 trillion by 2030. By 2025, it will contribute 13% to country’s GDP. Emergence of nuclear families, rapid urbanisation and rising household income are likely to remain the key drivers for growth in all spheres of real estate, including residential, commercial, and retail. Rapid urbanisation in the country is pushing the growth of real estate. >70-75% of India’s GDP will be contributed by urban areas by 2020. According to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra), the Indian real estate sector may stage a sharp K-shaped recovery in FY22. However, the overall sales in FY22 could still be ~14% below the FY20 levels.
India's Global Real Estate Transparency Index ranking improved by a notch to 34 in 2019 on the back of regulatory reforms, better market data and green initiatives according to property consultant JLL.
Indian real estate attracted U$ 5 billion institutional investments in 2020, equivalent to 93% of transactions recorded in the previous year. Investments from private equity (PE) players and VC funds reached US$ 4.06 billion in 2020.
The office market in top eight cities recorded transactions of 22.2 msf from July 2020 to December 2020, whereas new completions were recorded at 17.2 msf in the same period. In terms of share of sectoral occupiers, Information Technology (IT/ITeS) sector dominated with a 41% share in second half of 2020, followed by BSFI and Manufacturing sectors with 16% each, while Other Services and Co-working sectors recorded 17% and 10%, respectively. The office space leasing activity is expected to pick up in 2021 and is likely to be at par with the 10-year average, i.e., 30-31 million sq. ft.
Home sales volume across eight major cities in India jumped by 2x to 61,593 units from October 2020 to December 2020, compared with 33,403 units in the previous quarter, signifying healthy recovery post the strict lockdown imposed in the second quarter due to the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
According to the Economic Times Housing Finance Summit, about 3 houses are built per 1,000 people per year compared with the required construction rate of five houses per 1,000 population. The current shortage of housing in urban areas is estimated to be ~10 million units. An additional 25 million units of affordable housing are required by 2030 to meet the growth in the country’s urban population.
The Government of India has been supportive towards the real estate sector. In August 2015, the Union Cabinet approved 100 Smart City Projects in India. The Government has also raised FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) limits for townships and settlements development projects to 100%. Real estate projects within Special Economic Zones (SEZ) are also permitted for 100% FDI. Construction is the third-largest sector in terms of FDI inflow. FDI in the sector (including construction development and construction activities) stood at US$ 42.97 billion between April 2000 and September 2020. Exports from SEZs reached Rs. 7.96 lakh crore (US$ 113.0 billion) in FY20 and grew ~13.6% from Rs. 7.1 lakh crore (US$ 100.3 billion) in FY19. Indian real estate is expected to attract a substantial amount of FDI in the next two years with US$ 8 billion capital infusion by FY22.
Government of India’s Housing for All initiative is expected to bring US$ 1.3 trillion investments in the housing sector by 2025. As of December 2019, under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY (U)], 1.12 crore houses were sanctioned in urban areas, with a potential to create 1.20 crore jobs. The scheme is expected to push affordable housing and construction in the country and give a boost to the real estate sector. On July 09, 2020, Union Cabinet approved the development of Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (AHRCs) for urban migrants and poor as a sub-scheme under PMAY–U.
Government has also released draft guidelines for investment by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in non-residential segment.
The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has recommended all the states to consider reducing stamp duty of property transactions in a bid to push real estate activity, generate more revenue and aid economic growth.

To know more about Real estate Investment, major cities of the country are being highlighted which are as follows-

# Mumbai

Mumbai experiences similar urbanisation challenges as other fast growing cities in developing countries: wide disparities in housing between the affluent, middle-income and low-income segments of the population.
Highly desirable neighborhoods such as Colaba, Malabar Hill, Marine Drive, Bandra and Juhu house professionals, industrialists, Bollywood movie stars and expatriates. Up-scale flats have 3 or more bedrooms, ocean views, tasteful interior decoration, parking for luxury cars and sleeping quarters for maids and cooks. In 2007, Mumbai condominiums were the priciest in the developing world at around US$9,000 to US$10,200 per square metre.[6] Mumbai has more than 1,500 high rise buildings, many of which are just planned, but some already constructed or under construction. 
Over 7 million people, over 42% of the population of Mumbai, live in informal housing or slums, yet they cover only 6–8% of the city's land area. Dharavi, Asia's second-largest slum is located in central Mumbai and houses over 1 million people. Slums are a growing tourist attraction in Mumbai. 
Most of the remaining live in chawls and on footpaths. Chawls are a quintessentially Mumbai phenomenon of multi-storied terrible quality tenements, typically a bit higher quality than slums. 80 per cent of chawls have only one room. Pavement dwellers refers to Mumbai dwellings built on the footpaths/pavements of city streets. 
With rising incomes, many residents of slums and chawls now have modern amenities such as mobile phones, access to electricity, often illegally, and television.

# Delhi

Delhi has witnessed rapid suburban growth over the past decade. South Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida have added thousands of apartment buildings, Affordable Homes, shopping centres and highways. New Delhi's famous Lutyens bungalows house the prime minister, members of his cabinet, top political and government leaders, military officials, senior judges and top bureaucrats. New Delhi is also home to thousands of diplomatic staff of foreign countries and the United Nations. With India's growth, Delhi has developed into a business center, especially for outsourcing, IT consultancy, high-tech, research, education and health care services. Employees of these institutions are the source of growing demand for high-end housing provided by major builders such as DLF. 


# Bangalore

In the 1990s the information technology boom hit Bangalore. Y2K projects in America's IT industry resulted in shortages for skilled computer scientists and systems programmers. Bangalore has transformed into the Silicon Valley of India as over 500,000 well-paying jobs for young college graduates were created. The demographics of the city changed, new high-rise were built, campus-style office parks sprouted, vast shopping centers started to thrive, streets became crowded with new cars and gated expatriate housing estates emerged. 
Roughly 10% of Bangalore's population lives in slums. 


# Kolkata (Calcutta) 

The most sought-after neighbourhoods of Calcutta are generally centered around Lower Circular Road, Sarat Bose Road, Salt Lake, Ballygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Chowringhee and Golf Green. A recent building boom has converted sprawling British-era bungalows into high-rise condominiums and apartment-buildings with modern amenities. Kolkata currently has the second most number of highrises and tall buildings in the country, second only to Mumbai. The highest of them is at 65 floors (The 42). New suburbs are constantly being developed in Rajarhat and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. These suburbs will consist of major condominiums, complete with penthouses, many designed primarily for NRIs, expats and affluent residents. The tallest buildings in the city, The South City Towers and Urbana towers, are also condominiums. 
North Calcutta contains mansions built in the early 20th century during Calcutta's heyday as capital of British India. These buildings feature a courtyard surrounded by balconies, large rooms with tall ceilings, marble floors, tall pillars and crumbling artwork. Most of them are poorly maintained.The Marble Palace and other buildings received "heritage status" which provides them municipal funds and incentives to repair and restore. These mansions serve as reminder of the era of Bengali Renaissance. 
It's estimated that 5% of the population live in slums. Although the number of slums are less than Mumbai, they are scattered all over Kolkata in between affluent areas giving the city a rustic and poverty driven look.


# Hyderabad 

In Hyderabad, housing in modern ages in the 21st century is more modernized and developed than it has been in the past. The housing sector in Hyderabad has relatively sophisticated infrastructure. and is suitable for gated communities and villas, as well as higher-standard flats and condominiums. Hyderabad is home to several skyscrapers, including The Botanika, Lodha Belezza, etc. Roughly 15% of population is living in slum presently. Many residential infrastructure companies are well-established in Hyderabad.

# Chennai

In Chennai, Housing in the 21st century is also modernized and developed that the past. The real estate sector in Chennai has modernized and luxury infrastructure. The demographics of the city changed, new high-rise building were built, campus-style office parks sprouted, vast shopping centers started thrive, streets became crowded with new cars and gated expatriate housing estates emerged. Chennai is home to several skyscrapers, including Highliving District tower-H-SPR city, Anchorage, House of Hiranandani, Bayview House of Hiranandani, etc. Many residential infrastructure companies are well-established in Chennai. Roughly 26% of population is living in slum presently.

It is observed that in India there is privation of reliable economic method for price prediction of residential properties which results in inevitable way to trust the often-manipulated prices by middle person. The increasing purchasing power of subjects have led to increasing demand of property ultimately causing rise in prices of properties. However, the rate of fluctuation in prices should have a method for its traceability. Round the world, the ways such hedonic pricing method, multiple linear regression analysis, travel cost method, fuzzy logic system, AHP technique, ARIMA, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) techniques etc.
